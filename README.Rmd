`legocolors` provides a dataset containing several Lego color naming conventions established by various popular sources. It also provides functions for mapping between these color naming conventions as well as between Lego color names, hex colors, and R color names.

By default, nearest colors are computed based on distance in RGB space when an exact match is not found. This behavior supports the purpose of exchanging arbitrary colors for known Lego colors when the goal is to actually acquire and build something out of Lego parts. This focus is also one of the reasons `legocolors` uses BrickLink color names as the default naming convention. See `?legocolor` for details.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `legocolors` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("legocolors")
```

You can install the development version of `legocolors` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("leonawicz/legocolors")
```

## Palette conversions

The key helper functions are `hex_to_legocolor` and `legocolor_to_hex`. `hex_to_color` is also provided for general convenience.

```{r example}
library(legocolors)
hex_to_color(c("#ff0000", "#ff0001"))
hex_to_legocolor("#ff0000")
hex_to_legocolor("#ff0000", material = "solid")
legocolor_to_hex("Red")
hex_to_color(legocolor_to_hex("Red"))

x <- topo.colors(10)
hex_to_legocolor(x)
hex_to_legocolor(x, material = "solid")
hex_to_legocolor(x, def = "tlg", material = "solid")
```

While different sets of Lego colors are organized by `material` type, e.g., solid colors, semi-transparent colors, etc., these palettes are not useful for plotting data. The greatest value comes from converting useful color palettes to those comprised of existing Lego colors while still keeping as close to the original palette as possible.

## Palette preview

The `view_legopal` function can be used to quickly see a Lego color palette. It can plot a named `material` palette, but like the functions above, it can also display a converted palette if given an arbitrary vector of hex color values.

```{r plot}
view_legopal("solid")

r <- rainbow(9)
r

view_legopal(r, material = "solid", show_labels = TRUE, label_size = 0.7)
```

## To do next

What this package does not (yet) do: Currently, there is no ability to filter the color mapping to Lego colors known to be available specifically for simple brick and/or plate parts. This is why results may return exotic, difficult to acquire colors, or colors which are only used in specialty parts that may not be amenable to general building.
